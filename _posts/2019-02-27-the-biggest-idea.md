Around 2000 years ago, God loved me so much that He sent His Son to die for me. He wanted to make sure I didn't suffer the same fate. The most irresistible part of this idea is that He promised to rise from the deadâ€”and then followed through.

Where'd I get this idea? Someone told me. Before that, someone told them. That person was told by someone else, and the person before that was told by someone else... on and on, it goes all the way back to the original people who witnessed what happened. 

If someone claims they'll rise from the dead and then they don't, no one's going to waste their time talking about it. People have been talking about this guy for 2000 years. Clearly something happened.

Scripture helps clarify what happened on that day so long ago, but it's not the reason I believe it. I believe it because so many people before me were convinced that something happened. This "biggest of all" idea drives me to want to learn as much as I can about who this Jesus person is and what He actually said.
